# COTVCF UI Handoff

Use this when continuing work on the COTVCF WPF desktop app in this repository. It records the current project cleanup and UI decisions so another agent does not rediscover or accidentally undo them.

## Current Project Layout

- Main solution: `COTVCF.sln`.
- Main app project: `COTVCF.csproj`.
- The old `ConsoleApp1.csproj` identity was removed; everything user-facing should be treated as COTVCF.
- `COTVCF.sln` intentionally includes only `COTVCF.csproj`. Do not add `tests/COT_VCF.Checks.csproj` back to the solution unless the user asks.
- `.gitignore` includes `.vs/`, plus build folders such as `bin/`, `obj/`, `.work/`, `tests/bin/`, and `tests/obj/`.
- The app is a WPF app targeting `net8.0-windows`, `x64`, with SAP2000 API reference `CSiAPIv1.dll`.

## Build And Run

- Build the app with `dotnet build COTVCF.sln`.
- If the running desktop app locks `bin/Debug/net8.0-windows/win-x64/COT VCF tools.exe` or `.dll`, close it with `Get-Process -Name 'COT VCF tools' -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force`, then rebuild.
- For compile-only checks while the app is open, use `dotnet build COTVCF.csproj -o .work\build-check`.
- Launch the app from `bin/Debug/net8.0-windows/win-x64/COT VCF tools.exe`.

## Compact Engineering Density Pass

The UI was redeployed as a compact engineering/BIM desktop layout. Do not revert to the
earlier tall-header / large-button / blue-block look.

- Priority order for space: Preview Panel > DataGrid > primary controls > secondary info > chrome.
- `Theme.xaml` is the single lever for density. Current values: `Button` MinHeight 28, `TextBox`
  MinHeight 26, `ComboBox` 24, `DataGrid` RowHeight 24 / header 26, `TabItem` 152x42, base font 12.
- Palette is a neutral light chrome (`Background` #E6E8EB, `Surface` #F3F4F6, `Raised` #FFFFFF,
  `Border` #C7CCD2) plus a charcoal viewport (`ViewportBg` #22272E and the other `Viewport*` tokens).
  `Accent` #1F4788 stays; `AccentBright` #2E90FA is the selection / focus / cable colour.
- Keep headers to one small line. Section labels use the `Subheading` style (11 px, muted, uppercase text).
- Short button labels: `Connect SAP`, `+ Add`, `- Remove`, `Capture Baseline`, `Reset`, `Apply to SAP`,
  `Validate`. Icon-only actions (refresh, row delete, viewer tools) use borderless buttons.

## Navigation Style

- Left-side workflow tabs are a compact rail: fixed 152x42 items, `Surface` fill, a 3 px `AccentBright`
  stripe on the left edge of the selected tab, `Raised` fill when selected. No pill blocks, no angled
  decorations, no red mark.
- Tab headers show `NN  NAME` (12 px semibold, `Text`) over a muted 10 px status line.
- Avoid setting `Foreground` on the whole `TabItem`; it leaks into page content. Set tab header text
  colors directly in `MainWindow.xaml`.
- DataGrid selection uses a pale blue background (`Selected`) with dark text and a `SelectedBorder`
  cell border; avoid the saturated Windows default selection blue.

## Top Bar Connection Flow

- The top bar is compact (`Padding` 10,6): logo + title on the left; on the right a status dot
  (green when connected), a monospace `StatusLine` (model / units / lock, or `SAP2000 - <state>`),
  the `Connect SAP` primary button, an icon-only refresh button (tooltip `Refresh connection and
  geometry`), and `Help`.
- `Connect SAP` connects and immediately loads geometry. Refresh reconnects and updates
  geometry / load patterns / force sources for the current session.
- `MainViewModel.StatusLine` feeds the top-bar status text; keep it in the `Update()` notify list.
- Do not move connection controls into the viewer.

## Viewer Behavior

- `Structural2DViewer` renders on a charcoal viewport (`ViewportBg`) with a subtle `ViewportGrid`.
  Geometry is light: frames `ViewportGeom`, cables/tendons `AccentBright` (dashed / dotted),
  joints hollow with a `ViewportEdge` ring.
- Viewer controls are a small floating panel at the top-right of the canvas: projection combo,
  Fit, Reset view (returns to XZ), and a Show-labels toggle bound to `ShowPointLabels`.
  `ToolbarContent` still renders (top-left overlay) for contextual controls.
- Axis overlay sits on a dark translucent chip: X red, Y blue, Z green (brightened for the dark ground).
- Still supports wheel zoom, drag pan, double-click fit, `Home` to fit.

## Engineering Inputs

- Standalone `EngineeringInput` defaults to 220 px wide with an 11 px muted label above a 24 px
  Consolas editor and a compact unit suffix. Pass an explicit `Width` for inline/compact placements
  (e.g. the B / NStories row) and `Label=""` to hide the label; give those an `AutomationProperties.Name`.
- Do not apply the 220 px width to DataGrid cell editors.

## SAP Model Tab

- The SAP model page should prioritize the model preview.
- The old in-page title/description and large model-info panel were removed to give the viewer more height.
- The geometry summary stays below the preview.

## Loading Criteria Tab

- Tab 2 is `LOADING CRITERIA`; do not restore the former per-point Fx/Fy/Fz assignment grid or an Apply-to-SAP action here.
- Keep the viewer-left / inputs-right split, but the viewer is the dominant pane (~62/38, `GridSplitter` between). The right side stacks separate `APPLIED POINTS` and `LOAD DEFINITION` cards.
- `+ Add Load Locations` opens the existing WPF `SelectionService` dialog using points from the loaded geometry. The dialog supports search, multi-select, select-all, and preselects existing load locations. Selected names are mapped to the cached Global X/Y/Z coordinates, deduplicated, sorted by X then point name, and assigned one-based order values; the user does not need to preselect objects in SAP2000.
- Applied points are preview-only overlays on the existing viewer. Draw a fixed screen-size downward load arrow, normal applied-point highlight, stronger current-point highlight, and labels without modifying SAP geometry.
- Grid and viewer current selection are synchronized in both directions. Removing grid rows removes their overlays and arrows, re-sorts, and does not write to SAP2000.
- `LoadDefinition` is generic and defaults to `DL_Above` and `LL_Above`. Each row independently switches between single-qz mode and Min/Max/Step mode through `ApplyIncrementStep`.
- Disabled numeric cells must remain grey, unfocusable, excluded from validation, and derived from `ApplyIncrementStep` rather than separate UI state.
- Candidate values are internal. Single mode returns only qz; range mode returns `Min + n * Step` while the value is at most Max and does not append an off-grid Max.
- Keep `Out-of-plane tributary width, B [m]` above the load grid as a shared positive numeric input.
- `Trib. width B` and `NStories` share one compact horizontal line above the load grid (small text label + narrow `EngineeringInput`, ~118 / ~96 px). `View Candidates` sits at the right of that line, commits pending editors, then opens a read-only WPF DataGrid with `Applied Pt`, `Case`, `qz`, `TribArea`, `NStories`, and `FzkN`. Its summary line reads `N candidates for loading cases, applied at M locations.`
- Candidate preview case count is the sum of `CandidateValues.Count` across load definitions. Rows are the applied-point/case expansion. Tributary area uses X-direction midpoint tributary lengths times B; endpoints receive half the adjacent spacing. `NStories` is a shared whole-number input with minimum 1, and `FzkN = -qz * TribArea * NStories` for downward global-Z loading.
- Keep the `- Remove` action visually secondary to the primary `+ Add` location picker.
- `+ Add Load` creates an empty-name, non-increment row with qz `0.00` and focuses its Load Name cell. Each row has a compact delete icon.
- Validation is inline: qz must be nonnegative; Min must be nonnegative; Max must be at least Min; Step must be positive. No normal cell-validation dialog belongs in Tab 2.
- Load-grid numeric bindings use `NullableDoubleConverter`: clearing an active numeric cell stores `null` and leaves it visually blank instead of restoring `0.00`; validation may still mark the required active cell invalid.
- Keep star-sized columns with practical `MinWidth` values and horizontal scrolling as a narrow-window fallback.

## Truss Height Tab

- Layout: dominant preview on the left (~1.9:1), `GridSplitter`, then a scrollable right column with
  `POINT GROUPS` and `HEIGHT RANGE`.
- `HeightSummary` sits above the preview; `PreviewMessage` below it.
- Page content uses `Text` / `Muted` on `Surface`. If content appears invisible, check for inherited
  `Foreground` from tab styling.

## Cable Force Tab

- In-page title/description was removed.
- Cable force `DataGrid` also uses star sizing plus `MinWidth` to reduce clipped columns.
- Keep horizontal scrolling enabled.

## Iteration Tab

- In-page title/description was removed.
- The tab opens directly into the iteration summary/issues layout with the validation controls below.
